### Future Tasks/Ideas
- Implement Save and Print features
- Change field generation to be generated dynamically with javascript rather than static html
- Add support for auto-filled templates for routines that don't change, or change little from day to day or week to week
- Possibly port the app to React to allow more dynamically changing information, such as removing the Go button and calcuating results in realtime
